          What is Search Engine Optimization?

        </h2>

        <p>
         Search Engine Optimization is the process of generating a website and maximizing the number of visitors and making sure that your site has the most relevant needs to what your clients are looking for.


        </p> 

        <h2>
          Guidlines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page

        </h2>

        <p>
         CHECK OUT THE BIG TWO: ORGANIC AND PAY PER CLICK. Search results are mostly dominated by two particular indexes: the organic or natural search results, and the PPC (Pay Per Click) search results. The organic-results index is created by searchbots. For instance, Google uses something called a googlebot to retrieve pages. It’s common to talk about searchbots as if somehow they wander around the Web, moving from page to page through links between the pages, collecting the pages, and sending them back to home base to be analyzed and indexed. The search results typically put ten results from the organic index into the search-results page, though, those results are often interspersed with other types of search results. (In some cases, in particular when adding local results to the page, the search engines may display a smaller number of organic-search results, perhaps seven or eight.) Today, the three major search engines all display PPC ads, ads that cost the advertiser nothing until someone clicks the ad, at which point the advertiser is charged instantly. PPC ads are typically placed at the top of the search results (three or four results, though sometimes Google omits the top ads) and in a column to the right of the main search results.

                  The meta description tag in HTML is the 160 character snippet used to summarize a web page’s content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it. Crafting a readable, compelling description using important keywords can improve the rate of the page.

         What is the difference between ON PAGE and OFF PAGE SEO?

        <p>
          The difference between on page and off page SEO comes down to control. In on page SEO, you can target a search term through keyword research, create a page, and tweak the content for the best results. You have complete control over your optimization efforts. Off Page SEO is different. It relies more on promotion. These include link building, blogging, social media, and other off page SEO techniques to build awareness. Control is in the hands of your community.

On Page SEO: Optimizing code elements that search engines use to understand your page.
Off page SEO refers to techniques that can be used to improve the position of a web site in the search engine results page (SERPs). Many people associate off-page SEO with link building but it is not only that. In general, off Page SEO has to do with promotion methods – beyond website design –for the purpose of ranking a website higher in the search results.
